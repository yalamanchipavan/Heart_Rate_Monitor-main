# HEART_RATE_MONITER

Predictive Analysis of Heart Rate using OpenCV is a pre-trained classifier in OpenCV library object detection of frontal face in
images and video frames. Applied Fourier Transform which is mathematical technique used to analyze functions or signals in
the frequency domain Bulit an interface using PyQT5 to show the real-time nature of PPG signals which makes this approach
suitable for continuous heart rate monitoring in various applications.
